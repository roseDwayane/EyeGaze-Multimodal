Please help me add complete docstrings to the following code.
This project is part of a thesis, with the research topic focusing on eye-tracking data generation and classification using vision-language models. The code is mainly responsible for handling the Data Preparation I/O pipeline.

Use Google Python Style to write the docstrings

Each function must include:
1. A description of its purpose
2. Args: parameter names, types, and usage
3. Returns: the return type and its contents

Do not change the program logic â€” only add docstrings.

I will paste the code afterward. Please return the entire code with the completed docstrings.
