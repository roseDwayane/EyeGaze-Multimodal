# add docstrings
Please help me add complete docstrings to the following code.
This project is part of a thesis, with the research topic focusing on eye-tracking data generation and classification using vision-language models. The code is mainly responsible for handling the Data Preparation I/O pipeline.

Use Google Python Style to write the docstrings

Each function must include:
1. A description of its purpose
2. Args: parameter names, types, and usage
3. Returns: the return type and its contents

Do not change the program logic â€” only add docstrings.

I will paste the code afterward. Please return the entire code with the completed docstrings.


# split code
Please help me refactor the following code by separating it into modular components.

Split the code into pure utility functions with no I/O operations (no print statements, no file reading/writing)


Follow these rules:
- Utils files should contain ONLY pure functions
- Each function must have complete Google Python Style docstrings
- Do not change the program logic, only reorganize the structure
- Keep functions independent and reusable

The project context is: eye-tracking data generation and classification using vision-language models for my thesis research.

I will provide the code files next. Please return the complete refactored code with proper module separation.
